🩺 Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts the risk of heart disease using medical data like age, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc. The goal is to help with early diagnosis and prevention. We used the Heart Disease dataset and trained a machine learning model using Gradient Boosting.

🚀 How to Run
Download the notebook and csv file from this repository and open it in any Jupyter notebook or Google Colab.

✅ What’s in the Project
Performed EDA to understand the data

Scaled and cleaned features

Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier

Evaluated using F1 Score and AUC-ROC Curve

Shared important features and insights for healthcare use

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy: 96%

F1 Score: 0.965

AUC Score: 0.964

The model performed well on both classes (with and without heart disease)

🔍 Top 5 Important Features
These features contributed the most to predictions:

Chest pain type (cp)

Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia type (thal)

Oldpeak (ST depression)

Age

💡 Healthcare Insights
People with chest pain and abnormal thalassemia results are at higher risk

Oldpeak values and number of blocked vessels are key indicators

The model can support doctors in identifying high-risk patients early
